Discrete mathematics is a discipline with applications to almost all areas of study. It provides a set of indispensable tools to computer science in particular. This course reviews (familiar) topics as diverse as mathematical reasoning, combinatorics, discrete structures & algorithmic thinking.

This class will be following closely the book "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications" by Kenneth H. Rosen, published by McGraw-Hill. The following schedule is based on the 8th edition.
